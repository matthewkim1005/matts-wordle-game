HTML/JS/CSS Unit 1 Project: Wordle

My Game: Wordle/Mattdle

Decription: This is a recreate of the game wordle that you can play with just a mouse and/or keyboard.
A random 5-letter word is chosen and the user has 6 attempts to try to guess the random word. If the word correctly matches the random word,
the user wins!

Reason I chose this game: Me and my friends used to play this everyday when it first came out and it was a fun little bonding experience we had together, so I decided to recreate it.
